    "- Look at other MOOCs for data including Udacity, etc. and also at data science fellowship sides, like the Data Incubator, for example...  perhaps I can meta-abstract the key concepts that one might need for data science and use this as a starting point to prove out the idea behind the algorithm.  I think there is more consensus on what it means to be a data scientist today than, let's say, an \"advanced manufacturing engineer.\"\n",
